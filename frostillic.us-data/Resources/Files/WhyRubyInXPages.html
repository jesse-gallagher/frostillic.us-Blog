		<h1>Why Ruby in XPages?</h1>
		
		<p>The most obvious question that comes to mind when hearing about adding Ruby support to XPages is: why bother?
			After all, EL, JavaScript, and Java are all capable languages for their purposes, and Ruby doesn't allow
			you to do anything you couldn't, strictly speaking, do before. What it <em>does</em> allow, however,
			is the ability to work with a more-elegant language that encourages clean use of its advanced features.</p>
		
		<p>I don't claim to be a suitable advocate for Ruby as a language, but there are plenty of resources online.
			<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/">Ruby-doc.org</a> hosts and links to a plethora of information about Ruby
			is so great, including the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/docs/ProgrammingRuby/">Programming Ruby</a> book
			that I found particularly helpful.</p>
		
		<p>Personally, I'm a fan of the outlook of David Heinemeier Hansson, the creator of Ruby on Rails (a bit on Rails
			shortly). I've thoroughly enjoyed each presentation he's given, and if you're similar to me, you may
			enjoy <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/lectures/why-ruby/">this lecture</a> on the subject of what
			makes Ruby great.</p>
		
		<p>The best non-specific summary I've found for what makes Ruby different from other languages is this quote from
			Ruby's creator, Yukihiro Matsumoto:</p>
		<blockquote>Ruby is designed to make programmers happy.</blockquote>
		
		<h2>First Things First: Does This Mean You Can Use Rails in Domino?</h2>
		
		<p>In short: no. Rails is a web application framework rather than a language or an aspect of Ruby itself. Roughly speaking,
			Ruby is to Rails and Java is to XPages: Rails is implemented in Ruby and is thoroughly influenced by Ruby's aesthetic,
			but it's a separate software stack of its own.</p>
		
		<p>I like the notion of using Domino as an application server for Rails apps, but that would be, if possible, entirely
			distinct from XPages.</p>
		
		<h2>So What Does This Get You?</h2>
		
		<p>What this gets you is a way to write XPages applications using cleaner, more efficient syntax than Java and JavaScript.
			As an example, you could process a view of documents like so:</p>
<pre>regs_view.each_doc do |reg|
	reg.send "recipient@company.com"
	reg["Processed"] = "Yes"
	reg.save
end</pre>
